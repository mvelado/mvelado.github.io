						My name is Sidney Miguel Velado, but I often go by Mickey. I am currently a
						Mechanical Engineering and Robotics double major at Carnegie Mellon.
						I hope someday I can combine my degreeds to push the
						boundaries of what robots can do. I'm really interested
						in learning more about motion/path planning and computer vision.
						In my free time I love to watch European football and am an avid
						supporter of the Arsenal. I also enjoy playing video games, with
						God Of War being the latest game I binged.
					</p>
					<p align='left'>
						Despite currently living in the United States, it's wasn't always my
						home. I was born in Guatemala, and lived in Peru, Bolivia, and
						finally settled in Costa Rica. I had the privilege to enjoy growing
						up in an amazing tropical climate full of adventures. It made me
						love the outdoors and drove my passion for football, as well as foster
						my sense of Latino culture and pride, which shines in everything I do.
					</p>
					<p align='left'>
						Besides my current academics at CMU, I also have served in multiple student
						organizations. I am active in my fraternity Phi Delta Theta where I served
						as Social Chair as well as the IM Chair. I also serve in the Spanish and
						Latino Student Association as the Internal Outreach Chair and as a general
						member of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.

					<h2>Computational Engineering and Robotics Laboratory</h2>
					<p>As the school year started, I looked back on my experience working in a
						research lab over the summer. Even thought I continued to be part of the
						Biorobotics Lab during the year as well, I was looking for more opportunities
						to really learn more with hands on projects and building more and more robots.
						I found professor Shimada's lab, the CERLAB. I picked up a project that in
						being overseen and in cooperation with a Japanese ship company, Tsuneishi.
						The project they need focuses on cleaning the biomaterial build up on
						ships with a robot, that will hopefully be able to become autonomous. I am
						excited to apply the experience I have over to this project and learn new
						concepts of path planning and computer vision to finalize it. I will be
						using my mechanical engineering skills, ROS, C++/C, to rebuild, redesign,
						and program our robot to work and clean as much biomaterial possible. In my team,
						unlike before, I have the most robotics experience, which has pushed me a
						little more into a leadership role. I also look forward to do my best and
						prove that I can not only contribute to a project with techincal knowledge
						but also lead a project and work well with a team to ensure we have
						steady progress and ultimately show results. Check back for updates!</p>

					<h2>Robotics Institute: Biorobotics Laboratory</h2>
					<p>Over my junior year summer, I began working in the Robotics Institute Biorobotics
				    Laboratory, ran by Professor Howie Choset. I had the privilidge to
                    continue the project started by a graduate student Daniel Piedrahita,
                    under the guidance of a PhD candidate Steve Crews. The project called the Flyped,
					was a bipdeal robot with a fly wheel that it uses for movement and maintian balance.
					At first, I started with no ROS knowledge and used my skills in
				    Solidworks to provide a lot of the CAD and make hardware upgrades.
				    Additionally, I have used my machinery skills to bring the concepts to life
				    and produce the parts I model. Since then, I picked up a lot of very important
					skills. I learned how to work in a Linux environment, I also became experienced in ROS
					and sharpened my C++ and Python skills. I am currently working on an overall hardware redesign,
					Since the first robot design has a lot of inconsistencies and doesn't work the way we need it to.
					I am excited to be a part of the group of students working on some cutting edge research and look
				forward to publishing something soon!</p>

					<h2>Carnegie Mellon University Pre-College Counselor (Summer 2016)</h2>
					<p>Pre-College Counselors are residential staff members who are
					responsible for all non-academic experiences and activities for students
					in the Carnegie Mellon Pre-College program. Counselors have the most
					direct out-of-classroom contact with Pre-College students, each being
					responsible for 15-20 residential students. As a Pre-College counselor
					I had to be ready to advise and supervise my students with whatever
					they might need, may it be academically related or social. I managed
					an entire floor of residents along with a partner and took a class to
					advance my academic standing while holding the position of Counselor.

					<h2>Department of State Consulate and Political and Economic Office Internship</h2>
					<p>
						The summer of my junior and senior year, I was an intern at the
						United States Embassy in San Jos√©, Costa Rica. I worked for the
						Consulate office, in charge of American services abroad as well as
						the distribution of visas to prospective toursits. I had to work in a
						variety of different teams, rotating each week to be exposed to all
						the different kinds of jobs that were necessary to successfully run
						the office. Many of my responsibilities were data entry and data
						analysis, where often times I had to translate documents in English
						to Spanish and viceversa for official use. Finally, I also had a
						shift for the main telephone line to respond to general inquiries as
						well as re-directing calls to the proper officers and departments.
					</p>

					<p>
						During the second half of my internship I was promoted to the
						Political and Economic Office, a office that focuses more on
						executives duties and the politics of United States in Costa Rica.
						I worked in a team with 6 others, a team which reported straight to
						the United States' ambassador.
