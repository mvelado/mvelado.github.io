                    <h2>The Problem</h2>
                    <p>
                        A huge problem in the marine industry is biofouling The accumulation of biofoulers on hulls can
                        increase both the hydrodynamic volume of a vessel and the hydrodynamic friction, leading to increased
                        drag of up to 60%,The drag increase has been seen to decrease speeds by up to 10%, which can require
                        up to a 40% increase in fuel to compensate.With fuel typically comprising up to half of marine transport
                        costs, antifouling methods are estimated to save the shipping industry around $60 billion per year.
                        Increased fuel use due to biofouling contributes to adverse environmental effects and is predicted to
                        increase emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide between 38 and 72% by 2020. (From

                    <h2>The Robot</h2>
                    <p>
                        We present our solution to the problem, the CERLAB Underwater robot. For this development stage,
                        It's purpose is only to examine ship hulls for biofouling. This means our robot is going to be
                        used with a camera. It has two phases of motion, the 3D motion it will be using while it is underwater
                        and the planar 2D motion which is used when the robot attached itself to the ship hull, and depends only
                        the omni wheels. Omni wheels mean we have control of our orientation at all times, which is important
                        because we only have one camera. This also gives us the ability to move in any direction, regardless of our
                        current orientation.

                    <h2>Planner</h2>
                    <p>
                        I programmed in C++, a multigoal weighted informed A* search planner. I chose this for a few goals.
                        First, I wanted to have mutliple goals because during inspection there are always multiple areas to examine.
                        Then, I wanted to make sure it was an informed search to improve it speed, since we want to minimize the amount
                        of water damage. We use the euclidean distance as the heuristic. Finally, I added an additional weight to bias
                        the planner towards unexplored areas. It is evident that that will lead to suboptimal paths, but since we want to be
                        able to gather as much data from each dive, it's a good idea to go through unseen paths in case something we didn't
                        know about happens to the hull, or we discover something interesting. I then used that planner and interfaced it with
                        ROS, using my own custom messages and Rviz to visualize it.

                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        Overall the results were very good. The plannar works quickly and effectively, correctly demonstrating the behavior I
                        wanted of avoiding already used paths, but at the same time finding quick and good paths. Video below shows the demo,
                        as well as the setup a little more in depth.
