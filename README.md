# mysite

Hello!

This website was created to try to showcase myself to potential employers. If you like the design feel free to use it as long as you give me the original credit. I use it based off my HTML, CSS, and JScript knowledge gathered through a Coursera class as well through my own internet research. I also used Google Fonts and Google Colors as developer tools in order to help my styling.
